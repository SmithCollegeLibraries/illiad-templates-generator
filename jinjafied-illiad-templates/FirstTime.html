     First Time User Registration for Interlibrary Loan
    </h3>
    <p>
     To request an item through Interlibrary Loan, you must first identify yourself to the library's ILLiad system. To do this you fill out a registration form using your Web browser.
     <br/>
     Registration has three purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Entering your personal information into the ILLiad system means you will not have to supply the information again when making future requests.
     </li>
     <li>
      Having your e-mail and regular mail addresses on file with Interlibrary Loan enables us to notify you promptly and deliver materials accurately when 
							your request arrives in the library.
     </li>
     <li>
      By specifying a Username and Password of your choosing, you will have secure access to information about your requests. You will also be able to review
            				the list of items you have requested in the past.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
     About your Username and Password
    </h2>
    <p>
     During registration, you will be asked to choose a Username and Password. You will use this Username and Password when logging on to the ILLiad system in the future.
    </p>
    <b>
     Username
    </b>
    <br/>
    Choose anything you like, such as your name, abbreviations, or an alphanumeric code.
    <br/>
    <b>
     Password
    </b>
    <br/>
    Choose anything you like. We recommend that you follow good security practice and choose a password that is different from those you use to access other systems.
    <br/>
    ILLiad will encrypt your password, so it will remain secure. Only you will know your password.
